# INTRODUCTION
## This is a number guessing game that takes input from the player by asking for the to enter a value and it matches it to the one the system picks in its memory.

# AIM 
The system picks a number and
Asks the player for input
The system prints the result if it matches the number it picks and is stored in its memory

ALGORITHM 
## Interacting with the algorithm takes the following step by step process;


Step 1: Set a  range - choose MIN and MAX (e.g., 1 - 100).

Step 2: Initialize - set attempts = 0. Optionally set MAX_ATTEMPTS if you want a cap.

Step 3: The system picks a number within the range and saves it in memory

Step 4: The algorithm asks for the player to input a number (From 1 to 100). The user does this and press enter

Step 5: The system compares the input to the number it has picked and saved in memory.

Conditional operations of the algorithm comes into play using while loop and for statement

Step 6: If the user input is equals as the one in the algorithm's memory, it shows and output message "Your guess is correct"

Step 7: If the user input is higher than the one in the algorithm's memory, it shows and output message "You have guessed too high, try again"

Step 8: If the user input is lower than the one in the algorithm's memory, it shows and output message "You have guessed too low, try again"

Step 9: If the user guess correctly, the loop ends else the user initialize BREAK to end the loop




# Review
The input value range is too much. The instruction specify 1 to 10. It will take a lot of trying to actually guess the right number if one is to choose between 1 and 100.
Weldone!
